### Overview of Entity Service Modules

Entity service modules, like the example provided in `postService.ts`, are designed to handle operations related to individual entities in an application. These modules encapsulate all the logic pertinent to specific entities, such as posts, users, or products, including data validation, querying, and database interactions.

### Key Features of Entity Service Modules

1. **Data Validation**:
    - Utilizes predefined schemas (such as Zod schemas) to validate incoming data for creating, updating, and searching operations, ensuring adherence to expected formats and rules.

2. **Database Interactions**:
    - Manages CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations through direct interactions with a database client (e.g., Supabase, MongoDB).
    - Often employs helper functions to establish and manage database connections, enhancing modularity and reusability.

3. **Method Descriptions**:
    - **Create**: Validates and inserts new entries into the corresponding entity's table.
    - **Search**: Facilitates the retrieval of entity instances based on specific criteria, supporting filtering and pagination.
    - **Get**, **GetById**, **GetBySlug**: Retrieves single entity instances based on unique identifiers or specific criteria, with proper validation prior to querying.
    - **Update**: Updates an entity instance following data validation.
    - **Delete**: Removes an entity instance from the database based on its identifier.

4. **Error Handling**:
    - Implements comprehensive error handling using custom functions to format and return meaningful error messages, helping users and developers understand and rectify issues during data validation or database operations.

### Design Approach

Entity service modules are structured as objects containing multiple methods, each tailored to specific operational needs of the entity. This design promotes:
- **Modularity**: Each method addresses a particular aspect of entity management, making the module easier to understand and modify.
- **Encapsulation**: By wrapping the entity-related logic in a dedicated module, the rest of the application interacts with the entity data through a well-defined interface, minimizing direct dependencies on database specifics.
- **Reusability**: Common patterns and functionalities, such as error handling and data validation, are centralized within the service module, reducing code duplication and fostering consistency across different parts of the application.

This approach streamlines the development and maintenance of applications, especially those with complex data models and multiple entities, by ensuring that each entity's logic is well-organized and isolated from others.
