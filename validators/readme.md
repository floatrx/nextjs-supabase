### Overview of Entity Validators

Entity validators, such as those defined in `validators/post.ts`, ensure the integrity and correctness of data for specific entities within an application. These modules use libraries like Zod to enforce validation rules ensuring that only properly formatted data is processed or stored, enhancing data quality and application reliability.

### Key Features of Entity Validators

1. **Schema Definition**:
    - Defines rigorous conditions for data fields using validation schemas. For instance, `postCreateSchema` mandates the presence of fields (`slug`, `title`, `content`) with specific requirements like minimum length.
    - Applies transformations and defaults during validation, e.g., `slug` field transformation using `createSlug` to standardize its format.

2. **Schema Composition and Extension**:
    - Designed for extensibility and reusability. `postUpdateSchema` extends `postCreateSchema` by making fields optional and adding an `id` field for updates.
    - `postSearchSchema` shows schema reduction by selecting only necessary fields from the creation schema for searching.

3. **Error Handling and Messages**:
    - Provides immediate feedback on data validation failures with descriptive error messages, such as `"Title is required"` for missing title entries.

### Design Approach

Entity validators are built to be modular, scalable, and maintainable:
- **Modularity**: Each schema can be easily extended or reduced based on specific requirements, promoting code reuse.
- **Scalability**: Schemas can be modified or extended as the application evolves, facilitating easy updates.
- **Consistency**: Centralizing validation logic within validators ensures uniform data handling rules across different parts of the application.

### Purpose of Entity Validators

Entity validators protect the application from invalid data inputs, which could lead to errors, security vulnerabilities, and corrupted data states. They act as a first line of defense, ensuring that only valid data is processed or stored. This enhances the stability and security of the application and improves user experience by ensuring data integrity.
